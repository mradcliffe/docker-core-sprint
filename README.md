# Docker for Drupal Core Sprint

Provides a set of docker containers that can be used at a Drupal Core sprint.

Based on work by [BrianGilbert](https://github.com/BrianGilbert/docksal-core-sprint).

You should use a [drud/quicksprint](https://github.com/drud/quicksprint) release instead unless you are running Windows 10 or 7 without Hyper-V support (or cannot install and use Docker for Windows). This is intended as a simpler fallback option for DrupalCon sprints.

## Getting Started

1. [Get The Files](#get-the-files)
2. [Extract docker-core-sprint](#extract-files)
3. [Install Docker and Other Requirements](#install)
4. [Start Sprinting](#start-contributing)

## Manage Docker

### Start things

* Run `docker-compose up -d`.

### Shut things down

* Run `docker-compose stop` so that you do not lose your work later.
* Run `docker-compose down` to remove everything and start from scratch.

### Deploy code changes

* Run `docker-compose restart php` after you've made some changes such as adding a test.
